# Taskify

Excited to introduce Taskify, my latest project! Taskify is a task management application built with Next.js, powered by MongoDB and Prisma ORM for seamless data handling. Users can create and customize their project boards with a personalized workflow. Manage tasks effortlessly across "Todo," "In Progress," and "Completed" columns, or rename them as you see fit.
